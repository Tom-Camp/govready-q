# Q (by GovReady)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/GovReady/govready-q.svg?token=tqxfXNLktb4qXp6NmyW7&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/GovReady/govready-q)


Q is an information gathering platform for people, tuned to the specific needs of information security and compliance professionals.

---

## Development

Q is developed in Python on top of Django.

To develop locally, run the following commands:

	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
	deployment/fetch-vendor-resources.sh
	python3 manage.py migrate
	python3 manage.py load_modules
	python3 manage.py runserver

## Deployment

To deploy, on a fresh machine, create a Unix user named "site" and in its home directory run:

	git clone https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q q
	cd q
	mkdir local

Then run:

	sudo deployment/setup.sh

(If you get a gateway error from nginx, you may need to `sudo service supervisor restart` to start the uWSGI process.)

If this is truly on a new machine, it will create a new Sqlite database. You'll also see some output instructing you to create a file named `local/environment.json`. Make it look like this:

	{
	  "debug": true,
	  "host": "q.govready.com",
	  "organization-parent-domain": "govready.com",
	  "https": true,
	  "secret-key": "something random here",
	  "static": "/root/public_html"
	}

You can copy the `secret-key` from what you see --- it was generated to be unique.

For production you might also want to make other changes to the `environment.json` file:

* Set `debug` to false.
* Set the `modules-path` key to a path to the YAML module files (the default is "modules" to use the built-in modules). 
* Add the administrators for unhandled server error emails (a list of pairs of [name, address]):

	"admins": [["Name", "email@domain.com"], ...]

To update, run:

	sudo -iu site /home/site/q/deployment/update.sh
	   (as root, or...)

	~/q/deployment/update.sh
	   (...as the 'site' user, or...)

	killall -HUP uwsgi_python3
	   (...to just restart the Python process (works as root & site user))
